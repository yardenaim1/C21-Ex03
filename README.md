This small app demonstrates a garage manager with a console interface. This app uses a factory design pattern in order to create instances of vehicles, which can be of several types (using polymorphism):

Car
Motorcycle
Truck
Cars and Motorcycles can be either electrically or gas operated.

The manager has the following options:

Adding a new vehicle to the garage
Viewing license number of vehicles currently stored
Changing a vehicle's state in the garage (being repaired/finished its repair/fully paid)
Inflate vehicle tires
Fuel a vehicle (if it's gas operated)
Charge a vehicle (if it's electrically operated)
View full information of a vehicle (license, tires, gas amount/electric charge, etc...)
